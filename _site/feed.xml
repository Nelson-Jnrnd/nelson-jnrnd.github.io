        <title>Alpine in 2024: New Front Wing in Japan</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/trackmap.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Alpine unveiled their first significant upgrade for the A524—a new front wing aimed at reducing the car’s weight. Ahead of the weekend, Pierre Gasly highlighted the upgrade will be minor from a performance standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We don’t expect it to be major – we know it’s not going to bring us where we want to be but it’s a first step in the right direction, so definitely looking forward to see what it brings.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Pierre Gasly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;qualifying&quot;&gt;Qualifying&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second consecutive race, an Alpine car progressed beyond Q1, with Esteban Ocon clinching 15th place. This post delves into Q1, focusing on how Ocon managed to outqualify Gasly for the fourth time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/q1_gaps_drivers.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Q1 session showed significant inter-team variations, as the five eliminated drivers hailed from distinct teams, suggesting that driver performance played a key role. A notable three-tenths gap emerged between the Alpine teammates, in the following graph we can see where that difference was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/internal_delta.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time difference between them remained marginal until the last sector, where Ocon made significant gains from Turn 14 to 130R, and again in the final chicane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/turn_14.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the exit of Turn 14, Gasly corrected a severe slide, delaying throttle application and losing time down to the last corner. In the last chicane, although he managed to maintain control, he had to modulate the throttle to preserve rear traction, losing additional time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/turn_18.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the lap being very close between both drivers, it looks like the rears on Gasly’s cars overheat causing traction issue at the end of the lap. This seems to be a recurring issue from Pierre’s side of the garage as they already suffered from it in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/gasly_snap_suzuka.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alpine-upgrades&quot;&gt;Alpine Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/q2_improvements.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-small&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I will compare the car’s performance against other teams to gauge the upgrade’s effectiveness. Since Ocon did not improve from Q1 to Q2, it seems he might have reached the car’s potential in Q1, unlike other drivers who improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/q2_gaps_sector_percent.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at where the time was lost, Alpine actually holds its own in the fast flowing esses of sector 1, as we’ve noticed at Saudi Arabia and in the fast turns 5, 6, 7 in Bahrain where Alpine already was amongst the quickest (of the back markers). It’s in the third sector where Alpine is loses big amounts to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/telemetry_s1_annoted.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few insights we can take from the first turns. First off, there’s quite a big difference in top speed between the teams with Alpine sitting in the middle. Haas and Williams opting for lower downforce they gain up to nearly a tenth on the straight but lose a big amount of time in the turns. Interestingly contrary to Williams and Haas, it’s not in the esses but in the last corner, turn 6 that Alpine loses time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/telemetry_s2_annoted.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sector 2, Alpine has lower speed through the double right of 8 and 9. The more weekend goes by the clearer that Alpine struggles in mid to lower speed corners where traction plays a big role. In the hairpin they actually hold their own compared to RB and Sauber but lost time on Haas and Williams as they both braked later and had better traction out of the turn. Lastly, in the high speed section of 13 and 14 Alpine is decent, although we can notice very good performance from RB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/japan_2024/telemetry_s3_annoted.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final chicane, Alpine lost an additional tenth, braking earlier than all teams except Williams. This underscores their challenges with low-speed direction changes and possibly overheating issues as well. Gasly faced clear difficulties with overheating rear tires. While Ocon may have coped slightly better, he still experienced some of the same issues. This could explain the disparity in performance between Turn 10, where they were reasonably competitive, and Turn 16, where their performance significantly dropped off—similar to Williams, who also reported struggles with overheating tires during qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the upgrade the characteristics of the car remains the same with struggles on traction hindering their performance in low to medium speed turns. Their relative good performance in the high speed sections seems to remain stable as well. We’ll have to wait for further upgrades to see the team challenge properly the midfield.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alpine in 2024: Were points on the table in Melbourne ?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This Australian Grand Prix points were available for midfielders as Tsunoda, Hulkenberg and Magnussen scored when Verstappen, Hamilton and Russell retired. I’ll be analyzing the races of both Alpine drivers and try to determine if had things gone differently they could have been part of the scoring cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ocons-overcut&quot;&gt;Ocon’s overcut&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I was in front of Kevin, fighting with Alex, in front of Nico as well, so we were going to be in the mix for those ninth, 10th, 11th positions. It was going to be a fun race but unfortunately cut short with that issue with the tear-off.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Esteban Ocon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/lap_5.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the race start, the layout of the race looked something like this. Ocon was part of a 3 car pack with Magnussen and Albon. Hulkenberg on hards fell back from the DRS train with Gasly behind. On lap 6, Albon pitted triggering an early series of stops. Magnussen responded on the next lap but was undercut by Albon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpine instead chose to overcut as they had a lot of pace in hand. Looking at the laps 6 to 8, Ocon set lap times 5 to 7 tenths quicker than Albon and Magnussen on fresh tires (respectively laps 8 to 10 and laps 9 to 11). Unfortunately a slower stop meant they lost most of the time gained on track against Albon. With a pit stop as fast as Williams’s, Ocon could have been able to keep the position at pit exit, effectively overcutting both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/pit_seq_1.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lap times without in/out laps mean the addition of laps between 5 and 11 without the in and out lap for each driver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## Gasly’s strategy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We tried with the strategy, tried to put ourselves in some stage of the race a decent position in case there is any red flag”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Pierre Gasly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/strategies.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I’m trying to gather if the strategy the team opted with Gasly was better or worse than the regular medium → hard → hard. By pitting on lap 18 like Hulkenberg, Gasly did the longest stint on the mediums of all the midfield. Surprisingly, he managed to keep up with Hulkenberg on the hards as on lap 15 he was still within a 1 second before getting overtaken by the front-runner who pitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/lap_15.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy was in some way a hopping for a safety car between lap 10 and 20, which did happen on lap 17 as they pitted under the virtual safety car caused by Hamilton retiring. Unfortunately, the short length of the stoppage meant the race returned to green while Hulkenberg and Gasly were still in the pits, gaining less time than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/pit_times.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also notice the longer pit stop of Gasly, about 1.5 seconds slower than his direct competitor (and show how good Williams’s stop was for Albon). This meant Gasly came out behind Zhou and 7 seconds behind Hulkenberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/lap_18.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To estimate the time lost by the alternate strategy, the best comparison would be Hulkenberg and Magnussen, as Ocon did an unplanned pit stop on lap 17 to remove a tear-off stuck inside his brake duct we cannot use his data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/gap_mag_hul.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Magnussen had about a 2 seconds lead when he pitted on lap 8.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kmag came out about 18 seconds behind Hulkenberg and gained time with his fresher rubber.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hulkenberg pitted under VSC on lap 18 which meant his pit stop costed only 12 seconds roughly. Which made it equivalent in terms of track position to Magnussen’s strategy, although Hulk had now fresher tire to play with. Essentially, Hulkenberg and Gasly benefited from 8 laps fresher tire thanks to this strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly Gasly really struggled to get his hards up to speed as he lost nearly 3 seconds in the laps following his pit stop. In the blue circles we can see Albon being right on the pace after pitting while Gasly in the pink circles lost time in the warm up phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/gap_GAS_ALB_1_54.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## Pace comparison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare both Alpine driver’s pace, we can look at their stints on the hards as after’s Ocon extra stop, they had a near identical strategy. There is a lot of impurity as the front-runners started lapping them in the middle of the race, but their pace was very close. With Gasly struggling on his warm up of his first set of hard and having generally less degradation. On the last stint Gasly had much better pace, but as Ocon was dead last and realistically out of the fight he might have slowed down on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/team_pace_label.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m once again comparing only the laps on the hards to better estimate the pace order of the cars. It’s a bit hard to see as we’re comparing a lot of drivers, but in race trim Gasly’s Alpine was one of the quickest. In my opinion it’s quite misleading because of Gasly’s alternative strategy he was most of the time on a fresher tire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/pace_comparison.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this more clearly comparing the distance between Gasly and Magnussen on the traditional strategy. Because of the offset strategy, Gasly spent more laps with fresher tires (lap 19 to 33 and 43 to the end). The pace wasn’t terrible but the slow start of the stints for Gasly meant Magnussen gained more time in 7 or so laps than Gasly in 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/gap_mag_gas_strat.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can notice lap 38 to 40 where Alpine let Gasly out. Losing lots of time being overtaken by Stroll, Tsunoda and Hulkenberg instead of pitting, as they hoped of a safety car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/lap_38.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocon who was on a more regular strategy at the start, was matching Magnussen before his pitstop which is very positive for Alpine’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/race/gap_oco_mag_strat.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ocon matching and even pulling away from Magnussen after overcutting him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ocon did not struggle with warming up his hards, hard to say why, perhaps a difference in setup between both cars or struggles from Gasly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ocon gaining time on Magnussen after his extra pit stop with fresher rubber though.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ocon slowing down on his last stint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasly’s had little hopes of getting in the points considering his strategy did not pay off. His struggle on the warm-ups and the slow pit stop ended any chances of points for him. Ocon had a proper chance to at least fight for P10 with Albon and Magnussen if not for the tear off as the pace was promising. It’s impossible to know for sure how the pace would have looked throughout the hard stints, but the fight was on which is an improvement from the last 2 GP.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Ocon got out of Q1 - Australia 2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time this season an Alpine got into Q2. And listening at the reaction of Ocon it seems to be quite an achievement. In this post I’ll be comparing the laps of both Alpine drivers to determine where and how the time was gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;Ocon&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;78.659&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;78.217&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;77.617&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;Gasly&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;78.554&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;77.982&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;78.088&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both drivers did 3 laps, and while Pierre was the fastest during most of the session, it was the last run that mattered. Ocon improved his time by nearly 8 tenths while Gasly got slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trackmap&quot;&gt;Trackmap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/track_map.jp2&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/internal_delta.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-time-was-gained--lost&quot;&gt;Where time was gained / lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/turn_3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down to turn 3, Ocon braked much later carrying more speed into the corner gaining two tenths. Interesting to notes different techniques between the two drivers as Gasly let the car roll at the apex while Ocon keeps applying the brakes all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/turn_9.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fast turn 9/10 is where Gasly lost another good bit of time, braking much earlier than Ocon losing about two tenths once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## Different driving styles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both drivers were very closely matched in the final sector, but I think it illustrates perfectly a difference in driving style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/turn_11.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn 11 both drivers have a different approach with Gasly choosing to slow the car more and accelerate right at the apex. While Ocon carried more speed but couldn’t accelerate as soon without running too wide on the exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/turn_12.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three corners the difference is even more pronounced with Ocon often trail-braking into corners and being “smoother” overall with the brakes while Gasly prefers to brake as hard as possible and settle the car early in the corner, rotate and be on the throttle earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shifting-issues&quot;&gt;Shifting issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of qualifying Pierre noted that he could not improve in his last attempt as he couldn’t downshift in turn 1 and 6. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/video.frustrated-gasly-reveals-gearbox-issue-hit-on-the-lap-that-mattered-in-q1.1794294481057411877.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working with incomplete information, as the brake pedal pressure is not publicly available. But looking at the speed trace, Ocon braked earlier and longer yet carried more speed into the corner. From this we can derive that he had to be more gentle on the brakes. There’s not any visible gear issues in the data as Gasly downshifted for when it’s expected for his braking point though this might not be representative of what Pierre felt in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/australia_2024/qualifying/turn_6.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit puzzled about Gasly’s comment on turn 6 as he barely lost 0.01 second and I don’t see any shift problems, but perhaps the data doesn’t record attempted shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall looks like an extraordinary lap by Ocon as he couldn’t reproduce his time in Q2. With data available it’s difficult to understand how big Pierre’s issues were and how it impacted him. Although most of time lost doesn’t look to be related to shifting issues it could very well have been caused by a loss in confidence in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alpine in 2024: Saudi Arabia, Confirmation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After the difficult weekend of Bahrain, the team headed to Jeddah. This was an interesting weekend as it was the first time we saw the A524 on a different track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;qualifying-pace&quot;&gt;Qualifying pace&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/python/2024/03/07/Alpine-in-2024-Bahrain-Rock-Bottom.html&quot;&gt;The conclusions I made from last weekend&lt;/a&gt; were that the car is struggling on low speed sections from its overweight chassis and lack of mechanical grip. The team communicated that the car lacked in traction, but it was difficult to see in the data, we’ll see if this is more apparent on this circuit. However, it was decent in the high speed sections of sector 2, we’ll see if this confirms itself this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/q1_gaps.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpine is now 3 tenths away from the next team which seems to be more than Bahrain. We will dive into how that happened by first looking at the laps of both Alpine drivers. They were incredibly close with only 0.004s separating them, but there is more to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/trackmap.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/q1_ocon_gasly_2.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-xlarge&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&amp;gt; Looking at the telemetry there is a clear difference in setup as Ocon is consistently quicker on the straights and Gasly is able to carry more speed into the corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&amp;gt; Ocon loses big chunks of time in the high speed turn 4, 13 and 22. Summing up to about 4 tenths. Most of the time is gained back slowly on the straights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&amp;gt; Running higher downforce Gasly would be expected to gain time in the first and last corner, but he struggled with sliding on exit as he explained on his post qualifying interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the comparison with the other teams I displayed under the gap to Ocon and Gasly as they both used a very different setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/q1_gaps_sector_percent_ocon.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/q1_gaps_sector_percent_gasly.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we paint a similar picture as Bahrain with the car being closer to the pack in high speed (Sector 2) and struggling in the lower speed sections (Sector 1). For the telemetry analysis I’m using Ocon’s data, as his top speed was more in line with other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/top_speed.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, most of the time is lost in the turn 1 section. Under breaking compared to Haas, on traction compared to RB and Sauber or both for Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/telemetry_s1.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-xlarge&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the high speed turns of sector 2, the car either gain time or is equal to other bottom fielders. The lower downforce Ocon and Hulkenberg are running is helping in this section but there is notable performance in turn 15-16 that is not drag related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/telemetry_s2.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-xlarge&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sector 3 though, Ocon has to brake harder and lose time on all teams; except Haas because of they have a similar aero setup (Although Hulkenberg chose to brake later, keeping up with the others in entry but losing more time on exit). Once again in the last corner Ocon has to brake very early to have a decent exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/qualifying/telemetry_s3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-xlarge&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pace wise, this confirms the issues revealed by the drivers and Bruno Famin last week. The car is struggling on traction, and they have to compromise under braking because of it. On other part of the track, they are more in line with the very tight midfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tire-strategy&quot;&gt;Tire strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In free practice, both drivers followed an identical run plan. Short one laps run on medium and softs followed by longer stints on mediums for practice 1 and 2. Practice 3 being reserved for low fuel qualifying runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/free_practice/p1_comparison.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/free_practice/p2_comparison.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/free_practice/p3_comparison.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting fact of the weekend is that Alpine did not try the hards at all during the practices. This is quite unusual as the expected fastest strategy heading into the weekend is medium → hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/free_practice/compounds.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might have been looking to test different setups on the same tire to have more data or perhaps the strategist were banking on a stoppage happening later in the race. Prioritizing a longer stint on the medium, waiting to pit for soft under safety car/ red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/saudi_arabia_2024/race/strategies.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a safety car on lap 7 compromised that strategy and forced Alpine onto a long stint on the untested hard tire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not further analyse the race pace as Magnussen’s train and Gasly’s DNF make the data pretty pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alpine in 2024: Bahrain, Rock Bottom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I’m a bit late with the Saudi weekend already starting, but I’m analyzing in depth the Bahrain weekend of Alpine. To try to gather insights into the French Team performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;free-practice&quot;&gt;Free Practice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first weekend starts, it’s a cold shower for the team in blue. The performance of the car is not here, as announced, but the reality still hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice run-plan by Alpine was in line with the other teams, mostly focusing on soft and medium tires. As you can see in the following graph, only Red Bull used the hards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/fp_tires.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of short outings at the start of every session as the team dial in setups, but this is usual. The most important session during the Bahrain Grand Prix is FP2 as it takes place in the evening, in the conditions the most similar to those of qualifying and the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/fp_stint_len.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger the circle, the more stint was made of that length. As such, Alpine focused less on long runs than Haas, Mercedes or RB but so did other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not a lot we can take out from free practice, the teams having spent already 3 full days testing on this track they already have plenty of data on the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/fp_2_long_runs.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can do is compare the long runs that took place in the practice. I won’t do any deep analysis as I’m late posting this and the race already took place, but it’s clear Alpine has the slowest car going into the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We need to work on our speed over one lap but on the long runs we are closer to the others.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Esteban Ocon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;qualifying&quot;&gt;Qualifying&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P19 and P20… locking out the back row of the grid, there couldn’t be a worse start of the season for the team. Where and how much are they losing on one lap pace is what I’ll be looking at in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly I’ll compare the performance of &lt;strong&gt;Ocon&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gasly&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ocon : 1:30.793&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gasly : 1:30.948&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t analyze in depth the laps as they were quite close in performance with only about 0.15 seconds of difference. I’m using it more as a guarantee that the lap will we use to represent Alpine in the following section is mistake-free and representative of the car’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner_speed.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we notice is a slight over speed for Ocon (worth only barely 0.05s) going into the first corner as he got a very light tow from Albon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner_t1.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s little to take from the middle sectors as both drivers traded blows equally, but we can confirm, looking at speed on the straights and the overall performance in corners, that both setups shared similar aero drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner_s2.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in the last sector that Ocon gained about 2 tenths on his teammate. Keeping higher minimum speed into T13 and higher entry speed into the last corner. The brake shapes being relatively similar, I’m making the hypothesis that due to Gasly’s rushed out lap his tires were overheating (It’s impossible to know for sure from publicly available data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner_s3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_inner_brake_s3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on I’ll use Ocon’s lap when comparing the performance of the team to their rivals. We’ll first have an overlook of Alpine’s sector times compared to the field before diving into telemetry analysis of their direct rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_gaps.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, let’s look at the gap around a complete lap. Keep in mind these times are from the end of Q1 meaning the front-runners like Ferrari and Red Bull were not pushing 100%. Alpine’s gap to Ferrari is less than a second, which is the gap they had to in Bahrain last year. Essentially, it isn’t as much Alpine losing pace as it’s the others bottom teams making gains. Sauber and Alpine look to be the back runners although the gap to the front of the midfield (Williams) is only 0.5 seconds away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_sectors_percent.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, even with its overweight chassis, which would cost them most in the sinuous sections, the second sector is the only sector where the A524 is not slowest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bahrain, the first and last sector are mostly straight sections. The difference being that sector 1 contains slower corners in turn 1 and 4 while sector 3 has the fast turn 13 and quite fast turn 14. Looking at the performance, Alpine’s gap was smallest in S3. We could derive from this that Alpine is decent (or rather less bad) in high speed corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/trackmap.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasly responded “It’s not as much. It’s not as bad as you mentioned” when Jolyon Palmer mentioned the rumors of the A524 being 11 kg overweight. A known decent approximation for the cost of weight on an F1 car is about 0.03 seconds for every 1 kg of extra weight. Taking a guess we can imagine the car to be only 7-8 kg overweight which would bring a loss in lap time of 2 tenths. Considering the closeness of the field this would bring the Alpine right in the fight of the midfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_telemetry_1.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For clarity’s sake we’ll analyze the telemetry of only the closest 4 team to Alpine: RB, Williams, Haas and Sauber. The first noticeable point is that the time lost in sector 1 comes in the braking zone of T1. Ocon has to break earlier than Haas or Williams and harder than Sauber and RB. This causes Ocon to effectively be about 5 m “late” under breaking causing a loss of up to 5 tenths. On the other hand, the car looks decent on traction, regaining some lost time. Turn 4 is the same but less exacerbated, Alpine is first on the brake and caries less speed in the corner causing further loss of time (except Haas but looking at the dip in speed on exit it is likely due to over-steer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_telemetry_2.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a good corner ! In the high speed esses of 5, 6 and 7 the Alpine has the highest minimum speed regaining up to 2 tenths on the competition. The slow and downhill turns 8 and 9 are more of the same, with Alpine losing time on the brakes. (We can note how crazy good the RB is in this section, gaining nearly 0.7 s in 2 corners !)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/q_telemetry_3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All cars seem to be pretty equal in the fasts turn 11, 12, 13 (with a big loss of time for Haas due to Hulkenberg locking up). One interesting thing of note is that on the last two straights Alpine is losing time, about a tenth. But on the first two straights of the lap they weren’t. Which makes me wonder if it’s due to the way they use the battery over the lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, the car seems to struggle under breaking and in slow sections perhaps as it lacks mechanical grip, on the other hand it looks decent in high speed sections meaning the car has pretty good downforce. The top speed also doesn’t look too bad around one lap; but of course we don’t know how much less downforce Alpine could afford because of the weaker engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The car doesn’t react how I would like it to, but we have to do with what we have.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Pierre Gasly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s a general lack of performance. Too little driveability. The handling is not good. It’s a bit of everything. You’d expect the car to be terrible to drive, but it’s not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Bruno Famin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;race&quot;&gt;Race&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the race. To improve clarity I’ll once again only consider Alpine’s direct competitor, the other bottom 4 teams. To have comparable data, we’ll first look at the strategies employed by each of the team. For each team I picked the driver with the most “usual” race. Meaning I discarded Bottas, Hulkenberg and Sargeant because of their incidents during the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the following graph, the strategy employed on those cars were soft, hard, hard. (Except Gasly making an extra stop). Which is good news for us as it will make comparing pace much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/r_strategy.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off, we can look at the race of both Alpine’s drivers. It’s clear that Esteban Ocon struggled heavily in the second stint on hards. With inconsistencies and an overall pace slower by 2 tenths. The third stint was closer, but the difference in strategy make comparison impossible. For these reasons I will focus on the two first stints of Gasly as they represent the pace of the car better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/r_inner.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stints during the race are inconsistent because of fighting and other incidents but global take away is that Alpine is closer to the pack in race pace particularly on the harder tire but still behind. Another point would be that they seem to have much higher degradation than their competitors. Something that we could already see in the preseason tests as I pointed in my previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://nelson-jnrnd.github.io/python/2024/02/25/Alpine-in-2024-A-Fresh-but-Rough-Start.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/bahrain_2024/r_comparison.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is coming fast and the team will not have time to upgrade the car as confirmed by Famin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’re going to work, we’ve got a few days but there won’t be any evolutions on the car. We have a lot to learn about the car, things to fine-tune, because even though we’ve tried to optimize the car, there are still things to do on the set-up. But there won’t be any revolution and we need to work step by step.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Bruno Famin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But looking at their performance in high speed corners and as said by Esteban Ocon, Saudi Arabia should fit their car better than Bahrain :&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jeddha should be a track that fit our car better. So we hope it will work out better there than here (in Bahrain)”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alpine in 2024: A Fresh but Rough Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, F1 is starting next week, and I’m analyzing how the winter and the 3 days of testing went for Alpine. I went over most of the interviews of the off season to paint a general idea of how the team is feeling ahead of the first race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;postmortem-of-the-2023-season&quot;&gt;Postmortem of the 2023 season&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that last year was a disappointment with the team being leapfrogged by both McLaren and Aston Martin. The reason was a car that was difficult to upgrade :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think we had a great year [in 2022], that year, I think every time we touched the development of the car, we put load, and we took a lot of weight off the car as well. So there was there was a lot of performance to be had.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We knew we weren’t quite where we wanted to be this year, we knew that our developments were plateauing a little bit on the car, because of limitations that we had.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Matt Harman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A523’s Achilles’ heel was its narrow operational window, leading to a season of inconsistent results :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not because it’s difficult to set up, it’s because the window is so narrow – so you’re having to make compromises. It’s tricky. You go to a circuit where ride is important to the driver – and we can’t put the car there because of the performance loss.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Matt Harman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-changed-&quot;&gt;What changed ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the departures of big management figures Alpine is changing everything on the A524 as the main objectives are to improve both performance window and upgradeability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The A524? We have learned on the aero side, on the tire usage side, tyre performance, tyre degradation. That we have learned. And we decided to go for something which looks better, and let’s see on the track if it will be better or not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Bruno Famin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember the huge cooling vents that appeared on some track last year. This was another area of performance looked at by the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One of the things that you can’t see is underneath the bodywork, and under there is what we call the internal bodywork. This allows us to control all the mass flow through the car, from the beginning, as it enters into the sidepod, all the way through to the rear. That allows us to make sure that we optimise the cooling behaviour of the car.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We were a little bit more open than we’d like to have been last year. This year, we are in a much better position. That reduces the drag of the car and allows us to have an optimal lap time.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Matt Harman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives-going-into-this-year&quot;&gt;Objectives going into this year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both drivers and directors hints at future struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We have a new concept, the car is totally new, and when you do that you normally take a step back. I don’t say that this is the case, because we haven’t put the car down yet. But the plan is to improve it through the year and get more progress, the more that we go through the laps. It’s going to be crucial to get a good feedback straight away, to know where we have to improve, to see if the concept choices that we took are the right ones. It’s not necessarily that crucial where we start, but it’s going to be where we are mid-season.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Esteban Ocon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Famin seems more conservative than his predecessor Rossi and take 2024 as a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We are not going to set any expectation in terms of results, positions. A good 2024 season will be first to see a good improvement in the way we work all together at the factory, to be able to unleash the creativity, to extract more from our talented people, all the talented people we have in Enstone and in Viry.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Bruno Famin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is very negative but Gasly is still optimist about the dynamic shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I can see the mentality in the team. I can see the spirit, I can see the recruitment. I see where we’re heading as a race team. We are making the right steps.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Obviously, it’s not that straightforward in F1 when you come with a completely new concept, it might not provide all the rewards you expect from the beginning.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You’ve just got to be open-minded about it. But looking at the others, we get inspired by what they’re doing. There are definitely a couple of stories from last season, which definitely brings hope and motivation to the entire team.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Pierre Gasly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preseason-testing&quot;&gt;Preseason testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpine focused mainly on C1 and C3 tires, respectively the hards and the softs for next week’s Bahrain Grand Prix. It’s the only team bar McLaren that did not bring any tires softer than C3. This seems to be an intent of reducing the amount of variables during the test. And be ready to extract the most usable data out of the Grand Prix weekend as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/tire_selection.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the following graphs the team mostly did very short runs perhaps as they experimented with the setup. Each strings of dots represent a stint (ignoring in and out laps) you can identify that the team pitted if two dots are not linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example Gasly’s first and second outings in practice 1 were 2 laps long on the hard tire. The y-axis shows us that the second laps were more than 10 seconds slower suggesting a fast lap - cool lap run. This trend continued for the first 28 laps in which he entered the pits 9 times. It’s only on its 10th outing that Pierre Gasly did 4 consecutive laps at full pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_1_gasly.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_2_gasly.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_3_gasly.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_1_ocon.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_2_ocon.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_3_ocon.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to other teams, Alpine never did a run longer than 10 laps, which makes comparing lap time more difficult as there is more uncertainty around the amount of fuel in the car. Regardless I compared all of Alpine’s “long” stints to those of other teams (on the same day and same compound to reduce variables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking at those graph, keep in mind that some teams stints were longer, meaning Alpine could have had less fuel in the car which would be a bias in favor of Alpine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/c1_c2.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lap times in testing are to be taken with a grain of salt of course, as you can see Ferrari and Sauber being quicker than Red Bull on C1 long runs. But looking at the data Alpine seem to have higher degradation compared to other teams, especially compared to their overall performance on those stints. On the hard tire, most teams had minimal degradation, as the car burned through fuel weight their lap time stayed constant or even improved. This is not the case with the A524 who lost about 0.8s in lap time after only 8 laps. This of course could be related to their run plan, battery usage or other reasons, so this information is not to be taken out of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpine’s degradation on the softer tire was more in line with the other teams, except Red Bull and Aston Martin, which is not surprising as both teams were very kind on their tires last year. (We can note that Haas could well have improved their tire degradation, an issue they have been managing for quite a few seasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/assets/img/blog/preseason_2023/day_3_c3.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive-img-large&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think we can take out is that Alpine’s test were more focused on exploration than optimization as they probably tested many setup configurations. Performance wise, the pace between teams is too close to tell as the midfield will be tight for sure, but it looks like Alpine will be fighting at the back of it instead of at the front as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impressions-after-the-tests&quot;&gt;First impressions after the tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentiment is confirmed at the end of the tests by Gasly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not going to be an easy first race, we’re not going to start from where we would have liked.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The good thing is we’ve identified very clearly what we’ve got to work on as a team. Now, whether we’re able to fix it with car setup or not, for the first few races of the season, time will tell, but for sure there’ll be an aggressive plan of upgrades which we will need to close the gap.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It has been very clear with Esteban, we had very similar feedback straight away.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I think we’ll have to be patient, even if it’s not what we like as drivers, but clearly it might take some time before we really unlock the performance we want from that car.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Pierre Gasly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team is bracing for a tough start of the season, but a good thing is that they identified the areas of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you take away from this test ? Do you think Alpine will be able to leap up the grid during the season like McLaren ?&lt;/p&gt;
